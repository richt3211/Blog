## Timeline
As of now I am constrained to a timeline to complete my research project. I recently sent over this timeline to my advisor in an email so I'll copy and paste here with some modification. The University of Utah allows the senior capstone project in the Computer Science program to be research based 
rather than project based. For the research based track, there are two courses that you have to take. One is a semesters worth of reading and research and the other is dedicated to producing the thesis document. These are their recommendations and/or guidelines for taking the research track. 

### Undergraduate Research Course (Summer 2020)
* At least six weeks before the first day of class, submit a completed Pre-Thesis Approval Form (attached below), signed by the faculty mentor and Director of Undergraduate Studies. **Note:** this date was March 30th for the summer semester but I was able to get this waved because of the events surrounding COVID-19. I did get signed approval from my advisor, but need to get approval from the Director of Undergraduate Studies
* No later than two months before the last day of class, give an informal oral presentation of the thesis topic's background information and related work. 
* No later than one month before the last day of class, submit a Thesis Proposal Document signed by the student, faculty mentor, and Director of Undergraduate Studies.

### Bachelors Thesis Course (Fall 2020)
* No later than 3 weeks before the last day of class, give a formal oral presentation of the thesis work. 
* No later than 2 weeks before the last day of exams, submit the final version of the thesis document complete with cover page and advisor's signature.

## Current situation
As of now I have a good idea of the topic that I would like to research but in my head the exact thing that I want to research is a little flaky. This is the most immediate problem that I need to solv and should open up the doors to most of the other work that I have to do. 

### Milestones Before Thesis Writing
Here are some of my own milestones that I would like to hit and that seem reasonable given my current situation. I don't think it makes sense as of now to think about what I'll need to actually write my thesis, so I'll push that planning to a later time. 
1. Have a specific topic of research selected
2. Learn and gain practice with the tensor flow library (assuming that I'll need this for research which is still up in the air). The ideal situation would be a possible reproduction of anothers existing research in the same topic
3. Compile a list of current research in the area and start writing specs of what will become a relevant literature review. 
4. Begin thinking about and gathering the data set that will be used to conduct the experiment and find the results. If a data set does not exist that suits my needs, I may need to gather my own. 
5. Build the Neural Network architecture in tensorflow and run primitive tests on it
6. Finalize network architecture and run experiment on the entirety of the data set
7. Compile and interpret results and write them down

## Goals and TODOs
Given the existing milestones it would make sense to me to start coming up with deliverable action items that I can start to knock off of a TODO list. In reality this will be an ongoing process that I iterate on as I progress throught the project. I like to think of my own personal time management in terms of the software project management worlds of AGILE and SCRUM. I usually use Trello (TODO:link) for this process and come up with a list of tasks (backlog) that are associated with different categories of work to do. I'm going to start off by creating these categories according to the milestones I listed above and building a few items to get started with. I usually break the work into one week "sprints". Link to my Trello board(TODO)  

One thing that I have already struggled with so far with this project is understanding the deadlines for the work that I need to accomplish. Usually with all of my other school projects this is easy because it is done for me. Writing a Thesis is a little more difficult because it is such a large goal but it's hard to know what immediate action I should be taking. Because of this, I'd like to create my own deadlines for the milestones I listed above. Obviously, these will change as needed

### Deadlines for milestones
1. Select Research Topic - May 1st
2. Practice with Tensor Flow (small project completed) - May 11th
3. Compile current papers and write notes/reviews of each 
    - Papers that I've already read - June 1st
    - Papers that I need to read given the topic - June 15th 
4. Determine and gather data set - June 15h
5. Build initial model (ANN architecture) - July 1st
6. Final model and experiment - July 15th
7. Compile results - August 1st

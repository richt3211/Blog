The summer semester for undergraduate research officially started this Monday and I had my first meeting with my advisor on Tuesday. Our meeting was extremely productive and one that I have been looking forward to having for quite some time now. My advisor started off by creating a [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PU7EG0kYo9bGrStK4Rk58_2nS2a2OF_S5z4yRZWvT0k/edit?usp=sharing) which is going to be used as a meeting journal which will serve as a place for us to keep notes for all of our meetings and to write down our plans on a weekly basis. This couldn't make me more happy as it is starting to provide the structure that I am looking for with the project. Now that I've officially started the semester I want to work through what it is that I'll need to do and make a plan for hitting my goals. 

I also want to start writing a short update after my meeting each week with my advisor. The semester is going to be way short and so there is a lot that I'll need to do each week. On top of that, I would also like to start taking notes for all of the papers that I am reading. I already have a page that lists of the resources but it would be useful to go into more detail for each of the papers. This should be the basis for most of the content for my background presentation and will also provide some of the verbiage that I am going to need to actually write the thesis. 

## Timeline
I was given a specific timeline for some of the milestones that I need to hit. That timeline is as follows 
* May 18, 2020: Send a bulletized list of research goals, and a description of how success will be determined
* May 29, 2020: Background Presentation (usually to the advisor's research group)
* June 29, 2020: Thesis Proposal sent to Tom Henderson (approved by advisor)

I'd like to discuss in some detail what it will take to accomplish each of these milestones. 

## Research Goals and Success Definition
Because this is due soon I have already created a [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u5WN4kOTQl5YmhToeckGU7Dh17cRn4vWUKT0DKvu_88/edit?usp=sharing) that lists these out and have shared it with my advisor so that we can both make updates if needed. Right now the main goal is to adapt state of the art NLP transformer based models to music and compare them with other existing models to see what their performance is. I am questioning whether this will even be a valid technique to use and so I need to do more research to answer this question. This will include reading some papers and taking notes. I need to have this complete by next Monday (which isn't that much time), so the more that I can do this week the better. 

## Background Presentation
I am a little unsure of what exactly this is supposed to be but I'm assuming that it will be a short powerpoint presentation to my advisors group that essentially frames the problem that I am working on gives some of most relevant current research on the topic. Some of the papers that I have already read will be good content to use for this, but there is still a substantial amount that I need to read. I need to have a discussion with my advisor about this to see what his advice is. 

## Thesis Propsoal
The suggested outline given on the canvas discussion for this document is as follows. 

A proposal document summarizes the direction and scope of the research to be done. This document should be 5-10 pages and contain the following:

1. Title page with:
    1. Title
    2. Author (Student)
    3. Advisor (Faculty)
    4. Director of UG Studies (Faculty)
    5. Date
2. Abstract: detailing the main idea
3. Introduction section: describing the project
4. Background section: describing previous efforts in this area
5. Proposed Work: scope of work section outlining what will be done and how
6. Schedule: a plan, and time line of milestones for the work
7. References: citations of relevant literature

NOTE: The contents should be substantial enough to indicate that the student understands the background and context of their work in a larger research area.  It is expect that the student will reuse some or all of this writing in their thesis document.  

I don't think writing this document will be all that difficult as a long as I do the necessary work to get there. I still need to do a lot of reading and writing on the current papers that exist and if I can get this done I think that I will have the basis that I need to get started with this document. June 29 is only 6-7 weeks away so in the meantime I need to make sure that I have all of the understanding that I need to write the document and begin working on the implementation of my idea and experiment. I will need to write more about how I can specifically hit this goal as time goes on. 

I think that this has given me a good place to start and hit the ground running with the project. The summer is probably going to be shorter than I think and given that I am starting my internship next week things are going to get busy fast. However, I am excited to get started and I can't wait to see where the project takes me.

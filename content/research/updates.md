Now that I've got a little more organization on the blog I want to dive deep into research. My first semester of research officially begins May 11th and I am going to be meeting with my advisor starting Tuesday May 12th. Before this meeting I would like to have all my current research and thoughts organized so that during that meeting I can make a solid plan with my advisor going forward. There have been several papers and books that I have touched previously and I have messed around with some tools. At this point, I don't have a clear idea for what my specific research topic is going to be, and so I know that I need to get that problem solved very first.

## Research Topics
There are several different directions that I could take my thesis all relating to computer music, deep learning, and data science. Some of the areas are more well studied than others and have already seen some significant gains in both the public and private sectors. The following list is all of the topics that I can think of that I could focus the thesis project on.  

1. Music generation and composition
2. Music analysis (both from a musicological and performance perspective)
3. Music Information Retrieval
3. HCI tools for performing, practicing, and learning 
4. Music synthesis

### AI tutor
Right now the idea that I have for a research topic is building something like an Artificially Intelligent music tutor for the piano, with a specific emphasis on scale and drill practice. This would be something like a combination of categories 2 and 3. There are some papers which address this topic and the ANN architectures that are used to model it. There are also several companies that provide products that proport to do the same thing, although I am not sure what specifically the products are and how they work. I do need to find more public research in this area to build as comprehensive understanding as possible for what the current state of the art is. It may be the case that someone has already built what I want to, although so far I have not found that to be the case. 

### Music generation
Another direction that I could take the thesis is in music generation. There is a substantial amount of research that exists on the topic already so I am not sure what specific problem I would be addressing, but I think that it is the safest and best place to start in terms of understanding how to model music from the deep learning perspective. I can imagine several applications that could make use of music generation that may not exist, but I have not fleshed my thoughts on this specific subject enough. 

### Music Analysis
This is something that I have discussed with my advisor a bit. I have not given the subject much thought, but the discussions that I have had make me feel like this could be an exciting field for analysis. I think that going down this path would require a much more substantial understanding of music and music theory, but if I was able to pull it off successfully, I think it would be an extremely rewarding project. The great thing about pursuing this topic is that music is so subjective that there can be any number of novel applications using deep learning that most likely don't exist. I could exercise a great deal of creative freedom following this subject, so it is something that I am keeping myself open to. 

### Music Information Retrieval
This is perhaps the most well studied field in computer music. Spotify seems to be the company on the forefront of this research, as it deals with extracting out useful information (genre) and how it relates to listeners. I'm sure that there are deep learning approaches used in MIR but I haven't done any extensive research in the subject. It is still not clear to me what exactly music information retrieval is and how it differs from some of the the other subjects. I'm sure that the lines are blurred between them but this is a topic that definitely warrants further research for me. 

### Music synthesis
This is something that I haven't really looked into much. It deals more with the signal processing side of the problem than the actual musical structure, and as I don't know hardly anything about signal processing, my knowledge in the area would be limited. It would still be extremely useful to study so that I can better understand the representation of music and perhaps how to infer patterns from raw audio, but I don't know that it makes sense to pursue the topic for the thesis. 

Given my current understanding of all of the subject, I think I would be best fit to stick with my original idea and pursue the music AI tutor application. I do need to speak to my advisor about this to see what his thoughts are, but I think for now, that is what I will plan on. 

## Resources
I have been keeping some of the resources that I have found for reference and would like to put all of them on the blog for easy access. I think that it makes sense to categorize the resources by specific subject. Most of the resources are papers (the rest are books) which I should be able to directly link to on the page. I'm going to create a separate blog post that holds links to all of these sources by category. Here is the [Link]({{< ref "/research/resources.md" >}}). This will be something I update as I come across new references. I hope that it doesn't become too bloated, and I may have to clean it up in the future. 

I would also like to write up detailed notes for some of the articles and/or papers that I feel are important enough (most likely to cite in my final thesis). I'm going to organize these by a subsection underneath the research section. I'll also add links to my resources page to the actual review that I give. These reviews are going to serve as the basis for my research. I am not exactly sure what the best way to do a review is or which papers will warrant one, but I think it's a good idea to get started now so that I can build some momentum. This is something that I'll need to talk to my advisor about. 

## Tools
I am most likely going to be building a neural network architecture and running an experiment for my thesis. Right now the best tools to use seem to be the Python library TensorFlow. I don't know if I am going to need anything more than that, but if I come across something in the future I'll make sure to note it on the blog. I might make a similar page to the resources page that holds references to any tools that I might use, but for right now it doesn't make sense.  

One thing that I do need to do is get more practice with deep learning in general but specifcially with Tensorflow. There is an MIT lab that I found online that I need to finish working through, and once I am done with that I would like to find another project that I can start working on to get practice. There are several problems that I have been trying to solve in my part time job, and so I think the ideal situation is to start to use ANNs as the modeling choice for those problems. I'm hoping that I can get sufficient practice with Tensorflow before the summer is over that when it comes time to write the thesis my experiments are working. 

## Final Thoughts
I think this has given me a good place to start diving into the research project. There are two general types things that I need to accomplish in the near future. The first is to keep researching by reading and writing about other papers. The second is to work with Tensorflow and begin thinking about developing my own architecture. I do have a little more work to do with the structure of the blog, but once that is done I can hit the ground running.

## A little about me
Based in the Salt Lake City, Utah area, I am current senior in the Computer Science program and the University of Utah, incoming Software Engineer Intern at Salesforce for summer 2020, a lover of any scientific, technological, or philosophical endeavor, a very bad (but quickly learning) musician, and most importantly, a husband and father. I fell in love with Computer Science when I was 16 years old and for the first time watched a piece of software written when my high school Calculus teacher built a calculator from scratch in Visual Basic. Ever since then, one of my primary goals has been to find a career in the world of software, and 8 years later I can say that I have successfuly accomplished that goal as I transition from the role of student to working professional. Along the way I've read several life changing books, consumed hundreds of hours of podcasts, attempted to adopt a consistent exercise routine (and have never succeeded), learned several musical instruments, worked in construction, sales, and software development, and married and watched my child come into this world. 

## Why am I starting a Blog?
I once attempted to start an anonymous blog and failed miserably. I maybe completed 3 or 4 blog posts in before I threw in the towel and gave up. Not only did I not anticipate the amount of effort it would take just to get it up and running, I would never have guessed how difficult it was for me to write anything coherent, especially knowing that it would be publicly available. This was also back when I was single, jobless, and starting my first full time semester in University. Given my past experience and considering that I'm married with a child and about to start full time professional work, why would I go through the trouble again?

I keep asking myself the same question and can't come up with a reasonable answer. What I do know is that the itch to write about my life, experience and thoughts has never gone away and I don't know that it ever will. In the years since I made my first attempt at blogging I've come to more clearly understand who I am and what my goals are and have the confidence that I can finish what I start that I did not have then.

To put it frankly, the reason I want to blog is because I want to write.

## Current Exercise
Currently I am doing a 2 mile run just a few times a week. This has been great for mental clarity and improved energy as opposed to how I felt when I was doing no exercise at all. However, recently I have started to do it less and less and am realizing it is not a sustainable system. Part of the reason I have decreased is because I'm simply just being a bitch and giving myself excuses, but I think having some organization will help with my mental thought process. 

## What I need to do
As of right now I can think of three separate categories of exercise that I need and that would be beneficial. They are 
1. Cardiovascular
2. Strength Traning
3. Yoga/Stretching

Ideally I would be able to come up with a system that incorporates all three of these together in a somewhat coherent way and that is sustainable given my current lifestyle. The most important thing I need to consider when coming up with a plan is to not set goals that are too lofty and to focus on small acheivable milestones that I actually would accomplish. I'll break down some of the actual exercise that I think I can do by category

### Cardiovascular
Right now the most obvious activity is running. Because of COVID-19 the whole world is pretty much in quarantine, but in the future I would like to incorporate biking into whatever daily commute I have. I live in a fairly large metro area with a surprisingly well put together public transportation system so I would like to take full advantage of it instead of driving. If I could incorporate biking into my daily commute that should take care of all of the cardiovascular exercise by itself. 

One thing that I am definitely interested in exploring is HIIT (high intensity interval training). I've done one 10 minute HIIT workout in my life and it was so brutal I have been scared to do one every since. I have heard a fair amount about the benefits of high intensity training and how it can drastically reduce time spent exercising so from an efficiency perspective it is intriguing to me. That isn't to say that I would want to completely get rid of longer distance cardiovascular training but it is something work exploring. For now I am going to stick with simple 2-3 mile runs and if I can build some momentum there I'll look into making a change. 

### Stength Training
I have the most experience exercise experience with barbell weight training. However, I've made the recent decision to stop paying for a gym membership and don't have the space or money to buy my own set. As an alternative I've recently discovered kettlebells. In the last year I started to experiment with them and realized that they provide much of the benefits that barbell training does but are much more flexibell. 

Kettlebells were made popular in the US by a Russian named Pavel Tsatsouline(link to wikipedia). His most well known book for beginning strength training with ketllebells is named Simple and Sinister (link). I've heard quite a bit about this book on the r/kettlebells subreddit but have never read it. What I would like to do is buy the book with some starter kettlebells and start his program. I am starting a summer internship for Salesforce on May 18th, and as part of their compensation package they give all employees $100 a month to spend on anything related to fitness and health. My plan is to buy the book and start reading it before then, and then when use that money to buy kettlebells when the time comes. 

In the meantime I think it's a good idea to start with simple bodyweight exercises that I can do anywhere at any time. I have enough experience with bodyweight exercises that I would be able to keep myself busy in the waiting period. Simple exercises like pushups, pullups, and rows. 

### Yoga
I own a yoga matt and have done yoga a few times before but never anything consistent. Every yoga workout I have doen had been a guided exercise on Youtube and has actually worked fairly well. I don't know of any resources that are more conducive to a consistent routine, so that is something I'll need to explore. As long as I was doing at least a little bit to improve my flexibility and balance I would be happy. 

## Sample Routine
As I said I would like to come up with a system that would incorporate all of these aspects together. I'm not set at getting good at one of them in particular and am more focused on improving overall health and fitness together. A sample routine would like something like this. 
* Mon, Wed, Fri: 
    * 2 mile run (which I am already more or less doing). Right now my time is around 17-18 minutes. 
    * Bodyweight training: I found simple bodyweight routine after a quick google search from this (link)[https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/beginner-body-weight-workout-burn-fat-build-muscle/]. The article says to do 3 circuits with no break in between if possible. I'd estimate that 3 circuits would take about 15-20 minutes overall. 
        * 20 Bodyweight squats.
        * 10 Push-ups.
        * 10 Walking lunges (each leg).
        * 10 Dumbbell rows (use a milk jug or other weight).
        * 15 Second Plank.
        * 30 Jumping jacks.
* Tues, Thurs:
    * 20-30 Minutes of Yoga. For now I'll start by just finding random Youtube tutorials. 

This is certainly not a perfect routine and I don't know that I'll follow it to the letter but *it's a place to start*, and that's what matters to me. I'll probably be adding an exercise section to the blog and add more thoughts as I try to implement the routine. We'll see how it goes.

It has been a tough past few weeks. Wanted to pop in to the blog to start writing some of my thoughts down. I've been caught up with video games and TV non-stop for over a week, stopped playing the piano, and have barely been able to stay on top of my school work. Finals is coming up this week and so I need to take a second to recoup and get my shit together. One of the things I woke up thinking this morning was that I am not good at rewarding myself, either physically or psychologically, for work that I do accomplish and the things I have been able to do so far. Because I am not acknowledging this, I'll resort to something like video games as a way to escape from the stress that inevitably builds up over time.  

## My accomplishments and/or wins this year

1. Started playing the piano and got serious about it. Almost perfected (kind of) one song which I have never done before
2. Given that this will be my last semester I feel that I have finished out school strong. 
3. Done quite a bit of work for Alan and SunHomes
4. Feel a lot better about our budget and finances, although probably not so much in the last month
5. Have a solid internship in the summer 
6. Making good progress on the garden
7. Relationship with Vivian is improving 
8. Made some decent progress on my research project 
9. Started consistently exercising
10. Diet is much better, consistently fasting 
11. Haven't spent as much money 

Even typing these out I don't feel as if I should give myself enough credit. This is either because the expectations I have of myself are too high or that I really have a difficult time appreciating what I have and acknowleding progress. Either way I think this is a good start. I would like to journal every day, so we'll see if this happens

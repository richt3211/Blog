In the last month I have developed a mild obsession with fasting. I started by skipping lunch, then skipping breakfast and having a late lunch, and am now working towards something like a 20:4 intermittent fasting window. I've also experimented with extended fasts of 2-3 days. All of this has been coupled with an effort to cut out foods with a high amount of simple carbs and sugars and replacing them with healthy fats and proteins. I feel pretty good about what I am eating and how much I eat at the moment (although I do have my weak moments). Want I want to focus on is developing a system that I can follow when I need something to fall back a mechanism to track my diet so that I can measure improvement (or degradation). I'd like to start first by focusing on fasting

## Fasting
My current routine looks like something not eating till around 4PM and stopping at around 8PM. I'll start with a substantial breakfast like meal and then snack if I feel like it until dinner. I usually don't follow this schedule on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) where I eat without many restrictions. Because my wife is currently breastfeeding I am doing this alone which has made it more difficult, but it is starting to become a normal part of my routine. 

All of my extended fasts have been decided on a whim and were not planned. After consuming quite a bit more alcohol than I would have liked to last weekend (currently writing this on a Sunday afternoon), I drunkenly decided Monday morning at around 1:00AM before I went to bed to do a 3 day fast (as a way to cleanse myself both physically and mentally). It was difficult (particularly day 2) but I was able to pull through and didn't consume a single calorie or any other substance besides water in 79 hours. I am glad that I followed through with the fast but it completely threw a cork into my normal life and had adverse affects that I was not expecting. I walked away thinking that I knew I needed to keep doing extended fasts but with better planning and preparation. Before I do another extended fast I would like to do more research on the best practices for longer faster periods (I am not sure if a pure water fast is the best way to go) and put some thought into how I can plan it into my current life. Right now I am thinking that I want to incorporate a 3-5 day fast once a month and maybe a 7-10 day fast once a year. I don't want to decide until I do further research so for now I am going to stick to intermittent fasting. 

## Diet
My first meal usually consists of 3 eggs, a few tablespoons of almond butter or peanut butter, and a piece of fruit. I'll snack on cottage cheese and other vegetables or fruits if I feel particularly hungry after my first meal. My second meal (and the only one I'll eat with my wife) is around 7PM and can be anything from a simple black bean salad to mashed potatoes and chicken. Me and my wife do a pretty good job of mixing up our dinners but we almost always draw from a set of simple ingredients. They are: chicken, bacon, hamburger, black beans, green beans, quinoa, potatoes, salad, and brocolli. If my wife can talk me into it we will sometimes deviate outside of shopping for these basic ingredients, but for the most part we try to keep it simple. 

I am mostly happy with this diet. I do have a sweet tooth so if I am ever offered candy or sweets I won't be able to resist so I do need to work on keeping that in check. I will also drink alcohol from time to time but am ok with this as long as it is not in excess. 

## Data
The biggest thing that bothers me about my current diet is that I have no way of knowing if I am actually sticking to the set of rules that I have built for myself inside of my head. The main goal of this post is to write all of the rules down and explore ways of measuring what I am actually doing so that I can know where I need to improve (if at all). If possible I would like to roughly measure everything that I eat (exluding weekends) and exactly when it is that I am eating. I mentioned a 20:4 intermittent fasting window that I have been working towards. My goal is to hit this exactly and consistently eating the foods that I mentioned above. 

### Tracking Fasting Window
When I did my 3 day fast I used a fasting tracker phone app for the first time. The application named [Zero](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zero-fasting-tracker/id1168348542) allows the user to specify a fasting period and provides a simple graphic that shows the current progress. ![Screenshot of fasting app](../fasting.png). I'll start using this app every day that I fast and shoot for a 20:4 window starting around 4-5PM. This should help discipline my eating window and if I deviate outside of it I'll have the data that tells me so. 

### Tracking diet
I have tried to track my diet in the past and had some success. The app that I used was MyFitnessPal which still seems to be the most popular diet tracking application. I'm going to start out by simply logging everything that I eat using the app with no specific goal in mind other than just to know what I'm eating. This can be cumbersome and hard to remember to do but if I use it in tandem with the fasting application it might make it easier. 

### Tracking Weight
I haven't cared much about my weight in the last few years but I'd like to start measuring it. I need to buy a scale so that I can measure at home. The MyFitnessPal app allows you to track your weight so when I do get a scale I'll start adding the information there. Again, I don't have any specific goal, just want to start tracking it. 

Using these mechanisms I hope to gain as much relevant data as I can that I can then use to analyze my habits. If I like where I'm at I won't change anything

I started the blog originally and wrote quite a few posts that helped me work out my thoughts on a few different topics, centered around health. Since then I have not visited the blog much, and I would like to start writing consistently on the blog, for both personal and research topics. Things have been a bit crazy recently as I have been finishing up school, but I am officially finished with my last full time semester of undergraduate school. I've got a few weeks before my internship with Salesforce starts (start date is May 18th) and there are several things that I would like to accomplish by then. I'll list some of the things that come to mind by different categories

### Random/Personal
1. Get the AC working
2. Fix the sink
3. Plant the garden
4. Finish UO accounting
5. Come up with decent investment strategy
6. Make plan for clothes shopping

I'm sure there are more things that I may need to add 

### Research
I was finally able to sign up for the research course for the summer so all of the logisitics are finished at this point. I'll be meeting with my advisor next week for the first time. Before that meeting here is what I would like to have accomplished. 

1. Compile list of current papers
2. Make list of possible topics. 
3. Finish MIT project. 

### Work
After our last meeting Alan gave us some milestones that he would like to hit in the next two weeks. Here are some of the milestones and the TODO's to get there. 
1. Save models
2. Integrate with the CRM to get data for certain sites
3. Get models making predictions with future data. 
4. Integrate Python project with database

This may be too much or too little to accomplish in the next two weeks, but it's good place to start. 

There are also several other things that I need to figure out in my head. I have pretty much given up consitent practice on the piano for the last month and I would like to pick it up again. I feel as thought my habits are piss poor and could use work in all aspects. The following is a list of habits that I would like to take up consistently 

1. Daily piano practice
2. Daily writing/journaling
3. Wake up at 7am and go to sleep at 11pm. 
4. Reading/podcasts every day
5. Yoga a few times a week

Here are some habits that I would like to lose

1. Too much time spent on social media. 
2. Waking up too late (already mentioned above)
3. Time wasted with unintentional movie/television

It's probably worth it to write an individual blog post about each of these individual habits so that I can work out the specifics of how I would make all of them happen. I think that working on one should help with all of the others and I'm hoping that by the end of the year I can implement all of these habits. It will probably take at least a month to work on each one, so it would be appropriate to set up a plan with a reward system so that I don't burn out with each of them. I've laid out a lot of what has been on my mind lately so tomorrow (Sunday) I think I'm going to dive deeper into each of these to get that plan together.

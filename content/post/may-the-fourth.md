On Sunday I wrote about how I need to flesh out my thoughts on quite a few different subjects to hone in on my daily routine and pick up better habits. I would like to write about writing and this blog, as I feel as if it will be the central place that all other projects I have going on write will center around.  

I have written a little bit about what this blog will be about and the type of content that is going to exist but I think that I need to specify that more. Not only do I need to specify it's purpose but also how much content I will put on, how often I want to write, and what some of my goals may be. I'll start by touching on how much content I want to put here and how often I would like to write.  

In my ideal situation I would like to be writing every day, but I don't know how realistic that will be in my current life. Nonetheless, I'll keep that as my goal. Some days I know that I will write more than others and some days will be much more productive. What is more important is that I am writing at least something every day so that my thoughts are a little more than just thoughts. The goal then is to write at least something every single day. To ensure that this happens I'll need some way to track my progress to help keep me accountable.  

### Writing frequency
I could use the blog itself to track my results but I'm not sure that is the best strategy (how would I be able to track my blog writing consistently using the blog?). Other possible solutions might be to keep a phone app that will allow me to track the writing and show me my results. The issue that I have with this is that it's just another thing to keep in my head and the added complexity. I have thought about creating my own web application that would either be separate from the blog or integrated with it. This actually may be a better solution that it sounds because the work that I would put in building the application would probably be enough of an investment that I would actually want to use it to justify the labor. However, it would be a lot of work to throw together and on top of everything that I have going on right now I don't think it's the right thing to do.  

To start out with I think I'll do a something like an A/B test with both the phone application idea and the "use the blog to track the blog idea". Writing in and of itself may be enough of a system to track the writing. It sounds paradoxical but may actually work. I found an iOS application named [Momentum Habit Tracker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/momentum-habit-tracker-routines-goals-rituals/id946923599) that seems to have a decent layout for tracking habits. I'll start by using this with just a simple daily reminder to see how it goes. For the blog I'll think I start out by creating a custom week by week calendar tracker. To do this I'll keep it as one blog a week with a table in markdown that I update every day. The post for this has been created. Hopefully I can update it every day.  

### Writing content
I am not so sure if I can pinpoint exactly what type of content I will be writing about. I have talked about different categories of content that I would like to write about but I'm not exactly sure how I am going to organize the daily writing. Right now I can think that there will be two types of posts that I will write. One will be a "journal" type blog with absolutely no structure, whereas the other will be a blog post for a specific category or type of project I am working on. I do need to put more effort and organization into the blog design and these categories before I can specifically define the different types of blog posts, but I think that these two general categories will work. As I write more I think that the organization of the blog will become more clear.  

### Final Thoughts
I think that it's important that I don't get in over my head and commit to too much. I do have a lot going on right now so it's difficult to take on too many things, but it is also the case that I am wasting too much time on useless things, specifically social media. I'm excited to see how the A/B test goes and what the results will be. Looking forward to keeping with the blog.

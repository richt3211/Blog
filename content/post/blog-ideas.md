This is going to act as a central place for blog post ideas. Hopefully as I add to this list I can start knocking off some of the posts. I'm going to add the idea for the blog post as well as what category it is going to belong to. 

## Ideas By Category

* Finance and Money: 
    * The tradeoffs between short term saving and long term investing (House vs Stock Market). 
    * Down payment on a house. Is 20% worth it or should I bite the bullet and go with PMI to get into a home earlier. 
    * Side Gig and Passive Income Ideas

* Music 
    * Goals, routine, and structure for piano/guitar.

Feels good to be writing this post. Earlier this week I did some fairly extensive writing on the blog about what I wanted the structure to be and did some work on the blog itself so that that structure could exist. It is still not at the point that I want it to be, but I am making good progress, which is all that matters.  

One of the conclusions that I came to was that I wanted to use writing as the central place to structure my habits (and quite frankly, my whole life) around. Because simple journal entries like this are relatively little work it's a good place to start and build momentum from. 

I set up a [Link]({{< ref "/post/blog-tracker.md" >}}) to act as a way to keep myself accountable.

Feels good to be writing this post. Earlier this week I did some fairly extensive writing on the blog about what I wanted the structure to be and did some work on the blog itself so that that structure could exist. It is still not at the point that I want it to be, but I am making good progress, which is all that matters.  

One of the conclusions that I came to was that I wanted to use writing as the central place to structure my habits (and quite frankly, my whole life) around. Because simple journal entries like this are relatively little work it's a good place to start and build momentum from. I set up a [post]({{< ref "/post/blog-tracker.md" >}}) to act as a way to keep myself accountable. I also tried something like an A/B test where I downloaded a habit tracking app named Momentum to see which platform would work the best for tracking the habits. As of now, I only have one day marked for this week on the blog, whereas I had 3 days marked as positive on the app. If I remember correctly there were 4 days that I wrote this week. The results from the app tell me that it would be better to keep track of the results on the app and then add them in bulk to the blog later if needed.

Today has been a relatively good day. It's a thursday and the garbages are emptied Friday morning so I mowed the lawn. This is to prevent the grass clippings taking up too much space in the dumpster over the week. Besides that I spent a good amount of time working and am making some good progress on my internship. There are a few things that I would like to talk about in regards to my internship that have been on my mind.

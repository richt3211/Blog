The last month has been difficult, but interesting. I feel that I am at a very interesting place in my life and that things are coming to crossroads. There are some big decisions that I am going to have to make and it is scary to think about making them. I should be writing more so that I can work through some of my thoughts, but it has been so difficult lately to stay inside of my head given that I am always home and just want to get out of the office and away from my computer. However, there are quite a few things that I have been avoiding and it is time that stop letting my fear get in the way of doing the things that I need to. 

The first thing that I want to start off with is some of the small things that I need to get taken care of and can finish in the next hour or so. 
1. Finish finances for July. Done
2. Get with Mom and book room for next weekend. Done
<!-- 3. Get started on data download and preprocessing for research project.  -->

I was able to get these tasks finished. The next thing that I wanted to talk about was some of the things that I have been avoiding but are not little.
